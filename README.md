# User Management System 

This user management system was originally written by [Ajay Randhawa
](https://github.com/ajayrandhawa/) at https://github.com/ajayrandhawa/User-Management-PHP-MYSQL.

This is my attempt to refactor the application and modernize it. I will fix many of its security flaws along the way.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1
- Composer
- MySQL

## Installation

1. Run the command `composer install` to install all the dependencies of the application
2. Copy the file `config/db.example.php` to `config/db.php`
3. Change the details in `config/db.php` according to *your database details*
4. Migrate the database by running the command `composer migrate` 
5. Run the application with the command **php -S localhost:8000 -t ./** . You can change 
the port number from **8000** to whatever port number you like
6. Test the application in your browser by using *localhost:8000* in your browser.
